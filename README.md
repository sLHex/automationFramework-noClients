This is a barebones version of the runner featuring an example project
We are using a custom J-unit runner, kindly authoured by Ryan Dixon, and modified by myself in order to meet enterprise needs.
We are in constant collaboration so please feel free to reach out to me at Connor-Lovegrove@Live.co.uk

Reccomendations: Use IntelliJ over ecliplse (Most of the MArk downs in the project have it in mind that you use IntelliJ)
Also Java 1.8 is a requirement.
