Good news future automator, web is by far the easiest to set up!

All you need is the following:
ChromeDriver! -  https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads

Optional: GeckoDriver, EdgeDriver. - Search for the downloads these change alot

Okay so now we have a 'chromedriver' First let's move it to an easy path to call like documents.
Now it is in the directory we will call it from we need to do the following:
Open terminal
cd ~/Documents (Enter)
From this directory type the following
chmod 777 chromedriver

eh voila!

Now please see the example project for setup!
