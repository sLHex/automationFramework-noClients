For android running you will need a few things,
IntelliJ CE Edition - https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=mac - download the community edition.
Android Studio + Android device Bridge (ADB) - https://developer.android.com/studio/
Homebrew installed - https://brew.sh/
Appium  - https://github.com/appium/appium-desktop/releases/tag/v1.12.0 - Appium-mac-1.12.0.dmg


After installing the above you will need to update your bash profile

Open Terminal
Enter -
cd ~/                               -> This will take you to your home directory
nano ./bash_profile                 -> This will now open your bash profile in nano

Now copy and paste the following into your bash profile  (Changing the <YOUR USER> Parameter with your machines user)
This will return your current machine instances user.
If you are unsure of the name of your machine on a separate or new terminal instance type in "whoami"
Now copy and paste the following configurations into your bash_profile

export ANDROID_HOME=/Users/<YOUR-USER>/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:$PATH
export PATH=$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$PATH

Now hit Command o and then hit enter (This will write to your bash profile)

Now back on a terminal window (Not in nano) Type the following:
source ./bash_profile

You can check if this has been successful by typing the following into your terminal:
adb

This should show a list of ADB commands, if this works. then you are all setup and ready to go!

The example project is just a guideline for templating your module structure and best practices for
testing method implementation.
